        Customer Retention Benefits

      <p class="article-inner-para">
        Repeat customers shop more frequently and spend more when they do. Once you create loyal customers, your CAC drops dramatically. Loyal customers also significantly improve your Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which grows your company and leads overall to higher eCommerce revenue. In many industries, just a 5% increase in customer retention can equate to a 25% increase in profitability, according to a study done by Bain & Company.

        Customer Retention Strategies for eCommerce
      </div>

      <p class="article-inner-para">
        More than 90% of companies have some kind of customer loyalty program, and for a good reason: they work.
        One of the best ways to grow your customer retention rate is to start a customer loyalty program.
        Think about the rewards you can give. Some ideas that customers look for include:
        <br><br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Free gifts
        <br><br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   Exclusive discounts
        <br><br>
        ‌ <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>  Points for product redemptions
        <br><br>
        <span class="pink-dot-med"></span>   ‌Early product releases
        <br><br>
        60% of customers say that unexpected rewards are the biggest reason they stay loyal to brands.

      <p class="article-inner-para">
        Your marketing efforts have worked. Congrats! You’ve been able to drive people to your eCommerce site and check out your offer. So, why aren’t more people buying? Most eCommerce sites focus on price and product — and those are important — but just as important is the customer experience shoppers have when they visit your eCommerce site.
        <br><br>
        The key is making it easy to buy. Your site must be intuitive to navigate, fast to load, and an inviting showcase of your products.  You need to reduce any friction that exists on your site to build loyalty. That’s especially important in the checkout process. Once a customer puts something in their shopping cart, you want to make it as easy as possible to buy. Every step you add will cost you sales.
        <br><br>
        Don’t forget about mCommerce, either. The majority of eCommerce sales today are done on mobile devices, yet a surprising number of eCommerce retailers still haven’t optimized their sites for mobile. 62% of online shoppers say they are less likely to buy if they have a negative mobile experience.
